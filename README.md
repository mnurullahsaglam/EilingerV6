This is a project for a foundation.
Users can register and work on their applications through the user_dashboard.
Admins can check the applications in their dashboard and message back to the users.

Open Issues:
- How can I make the muultistep form better? How can I make it possible for users to enter incomplete data and save them as a draft even if some values are missing. Only at the end when the user sends in the appliation, all required fields need to be filled in according to the rules.
